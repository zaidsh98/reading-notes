## React: Component Lifecycle Events

### **What are component lifecycle events?**

React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events. These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.

## Mounting
When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

## Updating
Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order.

## render()
Render is the only required method in a class component. It will examine this.props and this.state when called. The render function should not modify the component state because it would cause a lot of bugs by changing the state every time it rerenders. I also should not directly interact with the browser. render will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false. Here is an example of using render.
