# What is a text editor?
***A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer***

## Types of text editors :
* NotePad++
* TextWrangler/BB Edit
* Visual Studio Code
* Atom

## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs :
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If
you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed
that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all
in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one
software package.
While you might not be ready, or have the need to use a compiler, or
a debugger when you’re just starting out in web development, you’ll
get to see how an IDE operates in your text editing software. When
you’re ready to use an IDE, you’ll be more confident in how to use it
because you’ll already had some experience with it by using your text
editor.
Me? I’ll stick with the text-editors I’ve mentioned above. I’ve been
using them all on and off for a while, but I can’t seem to make up my
mind which one I want forever and ever. What happens to me is that
I’ll stick with one text editor for a while, only to find out that the
others have all been updated so radically that they have new and
exciting features. So, I’ll start using that updated text editor for a
while, and in the meanwhile, the others will be updated. So, I’ll start
using those ones. It’s a viscous cycle.
It would be so interesting to hear what some of you are using for your
text editor. Please share and let us know which text editor is your
favorite and why. Let’s make this a nice robust list of our favorite text
editors for all of us who are new to web development.
## The command line 
*A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.*
*The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.*
