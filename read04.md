# What is JavaScript?

***JavaScript is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.***

***JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!***

***JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:***

* **Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.**
* **Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.**
* **Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.**
# Operators

***JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:***

> operand1 operator operand2

>> For example, 3+4 or x*y.
