# SQL.

| SQL       | NoSQL       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|    SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)    |   NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database     |
|SQL databases are table based databases|NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
|SQL databases have predefined schema|NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data|
|SQL databases are vertically scalable|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable|
|SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data|NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents|


- If the data is highly structured and clearly defined , conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

- Examples of real world : MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL

- NoSQL database good fit at the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

- NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

- NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage.

- SQL databases are vertically scalable, But NoSQL are horizontally scalable.

- SQL : Structured Query Language used to communicate with a database.

- ” A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model”.

- The logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures that relational database work with.

- Schema is a framework or concept that helps in organize and interpret information.

- If a database does not exist, MongoDB creates the database when you first store data for that database.

- MongoDB is more flexible than SQL.

- NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have.
