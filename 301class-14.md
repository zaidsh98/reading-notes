## Diversity

- “Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.”.

- “Companies with a diverse staff are better positioned to meet the needs of diverse customer bases, and the cash flows of diverse companies are 3 times higher than those of companies with more mono staff”.

- “example of a smoker who lives to be 100 does not disprove that smoking is bad for one’s health, anecdotes of companies that have succeeded in spite of homogeneity are not a counterpoint to the overwhelming evidence that diversity makes teams smarter and is linked to positive business outcomes”.
