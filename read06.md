# What are Functions ?

*A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.*

## Function Declaration :


**A function definition( Declaration )  consists of the function keyword, followed by :**

* *The name of the function.*
* *A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.*
* *The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.*

**For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:**

>function square(number) {

 > return number * number;

>}

## Function Invocation :

**The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:**

* *When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button).*
* *When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code.*
* *Automatically (self invoked).*
