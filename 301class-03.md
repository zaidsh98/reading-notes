# Passing Functions as Props.

## Lists and Keys
Given the code below, we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it:
> const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);


This code logs [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] to the console.

In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical.

## Extracting Components with Keys
Keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array.

For example, if you extract a ListItem component, you should keep the key on the < ListItem /> elements in the array rather than on the < li> element in the ListItem itself.

>function ListItem(props) {
  // Correct! There is no need to specify the key here:
  return <li>{props.value}</li>;
}
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Correct! Key should be specified inside the array.
    <ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
 );

 ## What is the spread operator?
InJavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

**“When ...arr is used in the function call, it ‘expands’ an iterable object arr into the list of arguments.”**

## What is ... used for?

**“Spread operator to the rescue! It looks similar to rest parameters, also using ..., but does quite the opposite.”**
