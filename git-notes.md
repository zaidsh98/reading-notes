# what is Git?

### *Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.*

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.


> Committed

Data is securely stored in a local database

> Modified

File has been changed but not committed to the database

> Staged

Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

# Workflow
## Local Repository Structure
***The local Git repository has three components:***

1. Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
2. Index: The area used for staging.
3. Head: Points to the most recent commit.
