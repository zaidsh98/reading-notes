# What is a wireframe ?

***Wireframing is a practice which allows the user  to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site.***

* ***Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change.*** 
* ***With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.***
* ***Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.***

# What is HTML ?


***HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.***

***The main parts of the element are as follows:***

* **The opening tag:** *This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.*

* **The closing tag:** *This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.*

* **The content:** *This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.*

* **The element:** *The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.*

# Semantics 

***In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)***

# Semantics in HTML 

***In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."***
> <h1>This is a top level heading</h1>


# Semantics in CSS

***In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?***

# Semantics in JavaScript 

***In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?***
