# Basics HTML and JavaScript . 
## What is HTML ?

*HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.*

### The main parts of the element are as follows:

* *The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.*

* *The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.*

* *The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.*

* *The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.*

## What is CSS ?

***Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.***

***CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .CSS file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .CSS file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.***

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

* Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
* Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
* Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.

## Operators

***JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:***
> operand1 operator operand2
>> For example, 3+4 or x*y.
