# What i understood from this reading assignment is the following :

* ***markdown  is a way to style text on the web by formatting text as bold , italic , adding images  and so on ... but markdown is a regular text with a few ** ***non-alphabetic characters such as*** ( ***  *, _ , #) . And it can be used around gethub as extensions like .md or .markdown *** .

* ***what i learned from the video is that gethub is the easy way to start your own website from the scratch even without using html or the need of database. and the gethub pages let you treat your website content withe the same level of care as the source code on all of your project . and you can use the grthub flow to manege changes to your website*** .
