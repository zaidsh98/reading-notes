# **APIs**

## What is REST?
- REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

- A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource.

## RESTful APIs
The following are design principles for RESTful APIs that use HTTP :

- REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

- A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource.
ex)
>  https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

- Clients interact with a service by exchanging representations of resources. Many web APIs use JSON as the exchange format.
ex) A response body represented in JSON {"orderId":1,"orderValue":99.90,"productId":1,"quantity":1}

- REST APIs use a uniform interface, which helps to decouple the client and service implementations.

## Organize the API design around resources
Focus on the business entities that the web API exposes. For example, in an e-commerce system, the primary entities might be customers and orders. Creating an order can be achieved by sending an HTTP POST request that contains the order information. The HTTP response indicates whether the order was placed successfully or not. When possible, resource URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

## Define API operations in terms of HTTP methods
The HTTP protocol defines a number of methods that assign semantic meaning to a request. The common HTTP methods used by most RESTful web APIs are:

- **GET** retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.

- **POST** creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource. Note that POST can also be used to trigger operations that don't actually create resources.

- **PUT** either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.

- **PATCH** performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.

- **DELETE** removes the resource at the specified URI.
