# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
## What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is **pure functions**. But what does that really mean? What makes a function pure?
So how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects

## Pure functions benefits
The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

- Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
- Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D.

# Immutability
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

In Javascript we commonly use the for loop. This next for statement has some mutable variables.
For each iteration, we are changing the i and the sumOfValue state. But how do we handle mutability in iteration? Recursion!
